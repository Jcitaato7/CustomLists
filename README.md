# Custom Lists

This Java program consists of two classes: `CustomLists` and `Main`. The `CustomLists` class implements a custom linked list data structure, while the `Main` class provides a demonstration of how to use the functionalities of the custom list.

## CustomLists Class

### Description
- The `CustomLists` class implements a linked list with basic functionalities such as adding elements to the beginning and end, deleting elements from the beginning and end, checking for element existence, finding the index of an element, and getting the size of the list.

### Methods
- `addFirst(int item)`: Adds an element to the beginning of the list.
- `addLast(int item)`: Adds an element to the end of the list.
- `deleteFirst()`: Deletes the first element of the list.
- `deleteLast()`: Deletes the last element of the list.
- `contains(int item)`: Checks if the list contains a specific element.
- `indexOf(int item)`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element.
- `Size()`: Returns the size of the list.
- `isEmpty()`: Checks if the list is empty.
- `print()`: Prints the elements of the list.

## Main Class

### Description
- The `Main` class provides a demonstration of how to use the functionalities of the `CustomLists` class.

### Example Usage
1. Creates a custom list.
2. Adds elements to the list using `addFirst()` and `addLast()` methods.
3. Prints the list.
4. Checks if the list contains a value and prints the result.
5. Finds the index of an item in the list and prints it.
6. Deletes the first item in the list.
7. Deletes the last item in the list.
8. Prints the size of the list.

## How to Run
1. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.
2. Run the `Main` class.
